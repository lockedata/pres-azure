> SOURCE CONTROL IS FOR ALL THE THINGS

<!--
# Why source control

>- backup your code
>- know *why* you made changes
>- share code
>- work in a team
>- deployment source / destination
>- automated testing and deployment
>- audit trails

## Who's a git?
Not who\* but what...

Git is source control that is

- open source
- distributed
- command line based (GUIs implemented)
- safe
- not source safe!


\* Well OK, Linus Torvald did name it after himself

# A (simple) Git workflow
## Clone a copy of the code {data-background="http://img.lum.dolimg.com/v1/images/clone-trooper-armor_607fbd6a.jpeg"}
Take a copy of the code for you to work on without preventing anyone else from doing the same, and most definiitely not damaging the remote copy

```
git clone https://github.com/stephlocke/Rtraining.git
```

## Branch the code {data-background="http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/hunter-s.-thompson-fear-and-loathing1.jpg"}
Branches are different containers of code - they don't impact each other. This means that you can make them for features, for trying something out, for releases etc 

```
git branch breakallthethings
git checkout breakallthethings
```

## Make your changes  {data-background="http://www.caribflame.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/obama-change-1.jpg"}

## State your business {data-background="http://crooksandliars.com/files/primary_image/14/12/respectcartman.jpg"}
Tell git which bits of code you're happy\* with. 

```
git add iLoveCursors.sql
```




\* For various definitions of happy

## Commit your code  {data-background="http://lovelace-media.imgix.net/uploads/299/94220ab0-fcee-0132-451e-0a2ca390b447.jpg?"}
Confirm your changes and tell your local git that you're happy with them

```
git commit -m "I loves me some cursors"
```

## Merge your code {data-background="http://aksports.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/merge-sign.jpg"}

Super happy with your? Publish it to the master branch

``` 
git checkout master
git merge breakallthethings -m "I didn't break all the things"
```

## Push your code  {data-background="http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/salt-n-pepa-push-it-commercial.gif"}
Put new code on the remote location
```
git push
```
